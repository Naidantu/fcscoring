Description: The fscoring package is designed to implement Bayesian estimation of the Generalized Thurstonian Unfolding Model (GTUM; paper under review) that can be seen as an unfolding version of the Thurstonian Item Response Theory (TIRT; Brown & Maydeu-Olivares, 2011). The TIRT model assumes a dominance response process that may not be the most appropriate for some noncognitive tests. Therefore, we developed the GTUM model that adopts an unfolding response process, which has been shown to better describe how people respond to noncognitive items (see Roberts, Donoghue, & Laughlin [2000] for the distinction between dominance vs. unfolding response processes). Although there have been several unfolding forced choice models, they are limited to specific types of forced choice test designs (e.g., dichotomous choice, pairs, rank, unidimensional blocks). The GTUM was intended to be as flexible as the TIRT model so that it can work with any block size, any response format (e.g., PICK, MOLE, or RANK; see Cao & Drasgow [2019] for details), and any number of response options (e.g., dichotomous choice vs. graded preference; see Brown & Maydeu-Olivares [2018] for details). Some useful features of the fscoring function include (1) the capacity to deal with missing data in a way similar to how full information maximum likelihood works, (2) the capacity to handle high-dimensional structure (e.g., 30 latent traits), (3) functions for results extraction and Bayesian diagnostic plotting. Users should be aware of the long computation time (hours) due to the use of the Bayesian estimator. The backend estimation engine was stan (Carpenter et al., 2017).
